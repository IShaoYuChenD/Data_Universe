Project Title: Medical Insurance Charges Prediction with Linear Regression

Introduction:
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict individual medical insurance charges based on various personal attributes. It serves as a practical example of a full regression workflow, from data exploration and feature engineering to model training and performance evaluation.

Problem Statement:
The objective is to create a model that can accurately predict medical charges for individuals. This is a classic regression problem that demonstrates the ability to handle numerical prediction tasks.

Methodology:

Data Preprocessing:

Initial data exploration to check for missing values and understand descriptive statistics.

Categorical features, such as smoker, sex, and region, are converted into a numerical format using one-hot encoding with pd.get_dummies(). This is done to prepare the data for the linear regression model.

Model Building:

A linear regression model from scikit-learn is used for the prediction task.

The data is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

Evaluation:

The model's performance is assessed using two key metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values.

R-squared (R 
2
 ) Score: Represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.

A scatter plot of actual vs. predicted charges is generated to provide a visual representation of the model's accuracy, with a red dashed line indicating the ideal "perfect prediction" line.

Technologies Used:

Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn
