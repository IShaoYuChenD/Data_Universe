Project Title: Bayesian Risk Modeling: VaR and ES with Student-t MCMC

Introduction

This project demonstrates an advanced approach to financial risk management by modeling asset returns using a Student-t distribution and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Unlike traditional models that assume a normal distribution and may underestimate extreme events, this Bayesian approach directly accounts for "fat tails"—the higher probability of extreme outcomes in financial data.



Problem Statement

The goal is to provide a robust and realistic measure of portfolio risk by calculating Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES). The project addresses a key limitation of standard risk models by explicitly incorporating tail risk, ensuring that the risk metrics are more reflective of potential losses during "black swan" events.



Methodology

Modeling with Student-t: The project assumes that asset log-returns follow a Student-t distribution, which has a parameter called degrees of freedom (ν) that controls the "fatness" of the tails. A lower ν value indicates fatter tails and higher tail risk.



Metropolis-Hastings (MCMC): A Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is used to generate samples from the posterior distribution of the model parameters (μ, σ, and ν). This method allows for inference without assuming a closed-form solution and fully captures the uncertainty in the parameters.



Posterior Predictive Distribution: Instead of a single point estimate for risk, the model generates a posterior predictive distribution of future returns. This distribution accounts for both the natural randomness of returns and the uncertainty in the model parameters, resulting in a more comprehensive risk assessment.



Risk Metrics: VaR and ES are derived directly from the empirical predictive loss distribution, providing a more robust measure of risk that is not dependent on simplified assumptions.



Comparison: The results are compared to a simpler, parametric (Normal) model to highlight how ignoring fat tails can lead to underestimating potential losses.



Key Findings

The Bayesian MCMC approach provides a richer understanding of risk by modeling and quantifying tail events that are often missed by standard methods.



The posterior distributions of the parameters provide a measure of confidence in the model's estimates, which is not available in non-Bayesian methods.



The VaR and ES values from the Student-t MCMC model are more conservative (i.e., higher) than those from the Normal model, correctly signaling a greater risk of extreme losses.
