Project Title: Video Game Sales Analysis and Visualization

Introduction:
This project explores a dataset of global video game sales to uncover key trends and insights. It demonstrates a practical data analysis workflow, including data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization. The project answers specific questions about sales performance over time, genre popularity, and top-selling platforms.

Problem Statement:
The objective is to analyze a dataset of video game sales to understand the market landscape. This includes identifying top-performing games, analyzing sales trends over time, and determining the most popular gaming platforms.

Methodology:

Data Cleaning:

The dataset is loaded and a preliminary check is performed to identify and handle missing values in key columns like Publisher and Year.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

The unique values and counts of important categorical features like Genre, Platform, and Publisher are examined to understand the data's scope.

A specific analysis is performed to identify the top-selling games within a particular genre, in this case, the top 5 sports games by global sales.

Visualization and Insights:

Time-Series Trends: A line plot is created to visualize yearly sales trends across different regions (North America, Europe, Japan, and other), as well as total global sales. This highlights the overall growth and decline of the gaming market.

Platform Popularity: A bar plot is used to showcase the top 10 platforms by total global sales, providing a clear view of which consoles and platforms have been most successful.
